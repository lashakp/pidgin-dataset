If you have foreskin, pull it gently and wash the underneath thoroughly.  If you do not wash under the foreskin well, some liquid substance called smegma can start to gather there.  Smegma is a natural lubricant which keeps the penis moist.  It is available on the head of the penis and under the foreskin.  If smegma builds up on the foreskin, it will start to smell and it will stop you from pulling your foreskin back thus becoming a breeding ground for bacteria.  This can cause redness and swelling of the head of your penis; this condition is called balanitis.  If you have a baby in the house, experts say you should not try to pull back the foreskin of a baby or young boy with force as it can be painful and cause him harm.  The reason for that advice is the foreskin could still be attached to the head of the penis and yet to be fully retracted.  At that stage of their development, it is not necessary to clean inside the foreskin."
